<h3>Dead fish in baiyangdian lake</h3>
<br>
<code>
In February and march 2006, baiyangdian, the largest freshwater lake in north china, known as " pearl of north china", was followed by a large area of dead fish.  This incident resulted in the total pollution of the 9.6 million waters of renqiu city, which was blackened and smelly.  All the fish in the cage died, and a large number of dead wild fish floated in the lake, and some of the aquatic grasses also became black and withered to death.  Investigation results show that serious water pollution, water dissolved oxygen is too low, causing fish caries is the main cause of the dead fish incident.
