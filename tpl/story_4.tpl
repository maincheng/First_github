The most distant way in the world,   is not the way from birth to the end.
<br>It is when I sit near you,  that you don't understand I love you.
<br>The most distant way in the world,  is not that you're not sure I love you.
<br>It is when my love is bewildering the soul,but I can't speak it out.
<br>The most distant way in the world,  is not that I can't say I love you.
<br>It is after looking into my heart,  I can't change my love.
<br>The most distant way in the world,  is not that I'm loving you.
<br>It is in our love,  we are keeping between the distance.
<br>The most distant way inthe world,  is not the distance across us.
<br>It is when we're breaking through the way,  we deny the existance of love.
<br>So the most distant way in the world,  is not in two distant trees.
<br>It is the same rooted branches,  can't enjoy the co-existance.
<br>So the most distant way in the world,  is not in the being sepearated branches.
<br>It is in the blinking stars,  they can't burn the light.
<br>So the most distant way in the world,  is not the burning stars.
<br>It is after the light ,  they can't be seen from afar.
<br>So the most distant way in the world,  is not the light that is fading away.
<br>It is the coincidence of us,  is not supposed for the love.
<br>So the most distant way in the world,  is the love between the fish and bird.
<br>One is flying at the sky,the other is looking upon into the sea.
