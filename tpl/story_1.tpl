The Fisherman and the Golden Fish
Once upon a time, there lived a fisherman and his wife in a
shabby hut near the sea.
Every morning, the fisherman went out fishing in the sea,
while his wife stayed home and weaved all day long.
They lived a poor life. Fortunately, the fisherman was very
good at fishing, so they didn't have to suffer from hunger. Days
went by. They led an ordinary life, without any change.
One day, the fisherman went fishing as usual. He cats his
net into the sea but caught only one.
